# Testing a Dynamic Admission Controller for Kubernetes
 
## Introduction
 
Kubernetes dynamic admission controllers let us validate or mutate our Kubernetes request objects to either approve, deny, or change the object upon creation. In this hands-on lab, we review a provided admission controller that add labels to a resource and then create the needed configuration to test it. We'll also see if we can update the deployment code to use our own labels.
 
## Solution
 
1. Log in to the server using the credentials provided:

    ```
    ssh cloud_user@<PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS>
    ```
 
 2. Create a new configuration:
 
    ```
    aws configure
    ```
 
 3. When prompted for an AWS access key ID, enter the AWS access key ID provided in the lab credentials.
 4. When prompted for a AWS secret access key, enter the AWS secret access key provided in the lab credentials.
 5. When prompted for the default region name, enter *us-east-1*.
 6. When prompted for the default output format, enter any format you prefer, such as *yaml*.
 7. Create a new cluster:
 
    ```
    eksctl create cluster --name dev --region us-east-1 --nodegroup-name standard-workers --node-type t3.medium --nodes 1 --nodes-min 1 --nodes-max 1 --managed
    ```
    
    This may take a few minutes for the EKS cluster to build.
 
 8. Update the EKS configuration:

    ```
    aws eks update-kubeconfig --name dev --region us-east-1
    ```

**Note:** When copying and pasting code into Vim from the lab guide, first enter `:set paste` (and then `i` to enter insert mode) to avoid adding unnecessary spaces and hashes. To save and quit the file, press* **Escape** followed by `:wq`. To exit the file **without** saving, press **Escape** followed by `:q!`.
 
### Update Deployment
  
 1. View the contents of the current directory:
 
    ```
    ls
    ```
    
    You should see there is a `webhooks` directory.
 
 2. Move into the `webhooks` directory:
 
    ```
    cd webhooks/
    ```
 
 3. Check the contents of this directory:
 
    ```
    ls
    ```
 
 4. Move into `label-add-webhook`:
 
    ```
    cd label-add-webhook/
    ```
 
 5. Verify that this is a mutating admission webhook:
 
    ```
    cat app/server.js
    ```
    
    You should see the line `patchType: "JSONPAtch",`, which confirms that this is indeed a mutating admission webhook. You should also see that the labels are pulled in from an outside path, rather than being hard-coded.
    
 6. Open the deployment file for editing:
 
    ```
    vim label-add-webhook-deploy.yaml
    ```
 
 7. In the `spec` code block, under `env:`, update the `value` line so that the environment is `prod`:
 
    ```
    value: '"env": "prod", "team": "dev"'
    ```

 8. Save and exit the file by pressing **Esc** and entering `:wq`.

### Create Test Resources
 
 1. Open the registration file for editing:
 
    ```
    vim label-add-webhook-registration.yaml
    ```
    
    You should see that the resource we're testing against are Pods, so we specifically want to create a Pod deployment.

 2. Close the file without saving by pressing **Esc** and entering `:wq`.
 3. View the contents of a test file within the `image-checker-webhook` directory:

    ```
    cat ../image-checker-webhook/test-latest.yaml
    ```

 4. Copy the contents of the `test-latest.yaml` file.
 5. Create and open a `test-pod.yaml` file:

    ```
    vim test-pod.yaml
    ```

 6. Paste in the contents of the other file.
 7. In the `name:` line, change the name to `label-tester` to refer to the file in the `label-add-webhook` directory:

    ```
    name: label-tester
    ```

 8. Save and exit the file by press*ing **Escape** and entering `:wq`.

### Test
 
 1. Deploy the webhook:
 
    ```
    kubectl apply -f label-add-webhook-deploy.yaml
    ```
 
 2. Check that the deployment completed successfully:
 
    ```
    kubectl get pods
    ```
    
    You should see that the `label-add` Pod is being created.
 
 3. Apply the registration file:
 
    ```
    kubectl apply -f label-add-webhook-registration.yaml
    ```
 
 4. Check to make sure the Pod has been successfully deployed:
 
    ```
    kubectl get pods
    ```
 
 5. Apply the `test-pod` file to test our webhook:
 
    ```
    kubectl apply -f test-pod.yaml
    ```
    
 6. Check that `label-tester` contains the labels we created:
 
    ```
    kubectl describe pods label-tester
    ```
    
    This should output a lot of information. In the beginning of the output, though, you should see the line `Labels` with `env=prod` and `team=dev`, which means our labels were successfully created.
