# Create a Stream Processing Solution in Azure Stream Analytics
 
## Introduction
 
Imagine you work at your local arcade hall: a cool environment with lots of vintage games and excited customers. Besides operating the machines and talking to customers, you are also the designated IT person.

In that role, your boss has asked you to write all the game scores, which are send to an event hub, to an Azure storage account as well. He wants you to do this using a Stream Analytics copy query.
 
## Solution
 
Log in to the Azure portal using the credentials provided on the lab page. Be sure to use an incognito or private browser window to ensure you're using the lab account rather than your own.
